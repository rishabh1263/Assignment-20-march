For example, if a categorical column has three unique values, then three new columns will be created, each representing one of the values. The value will be indicated by a 1 in the corresponding column and 0s in all the other columns.\n",

The number of unique values in each categorical column can be found using the `nunique()` method in pandas or by visualizing the data using plots."
